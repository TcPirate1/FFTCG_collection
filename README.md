# FFTCG_collection

Console app to manage collection of cards. This differs from the [Python version](https://github.com/TcPirate1/Excel_Searcher-Python) because it uses MongoDB to store the data rather than an excel spreadsheet.

![First mongodb document add through C#](first_mongodb_document_add.PNG?raw=true)

## TODO list
- ~~Get the application to search in project root rather than in /bin/Debug/net6.0~~
- ~~Adding cards to the database.~~ First document added.
- Add a MStest project into the same directory as this project.
