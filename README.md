# FFTCG_collection

Console app to manage collection of cards. This differs from the [Python version](https://github.com/TcPirate1/Excel_Searcher-Python) because it uses MongoDB to store the data rather than an excel spreadsheet.

![Searching for card by code](find_card_by_code.PNG?raw=true)

## TODO list

- ~~Get the application to search in project root rather than in /bin/Debug/net6.0~~
- ~~Adding cards to the database.~~ First document added.
- ~~Create function to search for a card~~ Can search by name or code
- ~~Create function to edit a card.~~ Test the function to make sure its working.
